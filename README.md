# Movie app
The idea behind the app is that the user can search two movies side-by-side on screen. The app displays both of their plots along side their respective posters while also comparing between their ratings, awards, and how much money they made using the fetched data from the omdb API.

## Built with:
* Vanilla JavaScript
